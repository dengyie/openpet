> Release track: `v1.0.1-rc.2`

This document is the current status snapshot. Detailed implementation history belongs in `docs/phases/`; detailed review findings belong in `docs/reviews/`.

## Executive Summary

OpenPet has reached the intended desktop platform shape: Electron pet runtime, React Control Center, pet packs, AI behavior, local extension documentation with explicit `entries.setup` execution, language-neutral explicit `entries.commands` process execution, short-lived command bridge support, creator-tools action reads / validation / bounded writes, package-local frame inspection, and package-local frame import/sprite generation for declaration-only commands, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, explicit loopback service health checks, opt-in host-managed periodic health checks for running services, best-effort service process-group cleanup, exit-confirmed setup/command/service stop semantics, bounded host-side force stop for stubborn services, host-owned process-tree fallback cleanup for explicit local-process stop paths, structured maintainer approval rehearsal for extension submission bundles, existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal evidence, remote-source submission rehearsal evidence, local HTTP/MCP, release evidence tooling including macOS evidence capture, workflow artifact upload, permanent artifact archive handoff, reviewed Windows smoke and desktop picker archive gates, and a TypeScript boundary baseline.

The project is strongest on macOS. Windows build and evidence tooling exists, but Windows must stay **not release-ready** until signed artifacts and real Windows smoke reports are archived.

The extension ecosystem has also crossed another platform threshold: declaration-only local command entries no longer need the legacy JavaScript SDK path just to make the pet speak or react, and creator-tools entries now have host-backed authoring slices for bounded action configuration reads/writes, package-local frame inspection, and package-local frame import/sprite generation. The wider ecosystem still stays open, local-first, and honest about trust limits.

## Current Product Shape

| Area | Current State | Evidence |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Desktop pet runtime | Transparent Electron pet window with movement, actions, speech bubbles, and pet pack switching | `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `src/main/services/pet-service.js` |
| Control Center | React + Vite app with Pet, Actions, AI, Plugins, Catalog, Service, and About tabs | `src/control-center/`, `tests/control-center/` |
| Pet packs | Legacy cat, OpenPet packs, Codex pet directory/zip import, bundled read-only packs, export/provenance | `src/main/pet-pack/`, `src/main/services/pet-pack-service.js` |
| AI | OpenAI-compatible chat, main-process secret storage, behavior decisions, replay, redacted diagnostics | `src/main/services/ai-service.js`, `src/main/services/behavior-orchestrator-service.js` |
| Extensions | Developer-first ecosystem docs, current legacy SDK compatibility, normalized `entries` declarations including explicit setup execution, `entries.commands` support through the existing JavaScript compatibility runner and explicit short-lived process execution for declaration-only local extensions, command result feedback in Control Center, short-lived bridge access for declaration-only commands, host-owned creator data/cache/log directories for declaration-only command runs, creator-tools action reads / validation / bounded writes plus package-local frame inspection and package-local frame import/sprite generation through the short-lived bridge, Control Center declaration visibility, explicit HTTP/HTTPS dashboard opening, explicit `entries.services` start/stop with runtime state and logs, manual loopback-only service health checks, opt-in host-managed periodic health checks for running services, best-effort process-group cleanup, exit-confirmed setup/command/service stop semantics, bounded host-side force stop for stubborn services, host-owned process-tree fallback cleanup across explicit service/setup/declaration-command stop paths, validation, submission tooling, catalog install, scaffold author rehearsal, existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal, remote-source submission rehearsal, and maintainer approval rehearsal; command/setup/service spawns do not use shell expansion, setup and commands never run during install/enable, services do not auto-start, maintainer approval remains a human review artifact, and universal process-tree guarantees remain out of scope | `docs/plugin-development.md`, `docs/plugin-ecosystem-rules.md`, `docs/plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md`, `src/main/plugins/manifest.js`, `src/main/services/plugin-service.js`, `src/main/services/action-service.js`, `src/main/services/service-process-tree.js` |
| Local API | Loopback-only HTTP and MCP, token gated, logged, disabled by default | `src/main/services/local-http-service.js` |
| Release evidence | Packaged runtime evidence tooling, runtime/picker evidence-link gate, Windows smoke and desktop picker evidence summary/archive manifests, macOS codesign/notarization/Gatekeeper evidence capture with workflow artifact upload and permanent artifact archive handoff, release archive reviewed-archive gates, signed release closure gate, Windows smoke/report tooling | `scripts/create-*-smoke-*`, `scripts/create-macos-release-evidence.js`, `scripts/create-macos-release-evidence-archive.js`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `docs/release-evidence/` |
| TypeScript | Shared contracts, typed Control Center view defaults, typed API facade, typed Control Center hooks, typed pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, representative payload fixtures | `src/shared/openpet-contracts.ts`, `src/control-center/src/api/control-center-api.ts`, `src/control-center/src/hooks/`, `src/control-center/src/panes/`, `src/main/control-center-adapters.js` |

## Validation Baseline

Current local baseline:

```bash
npm test                     # 586/586 Node tests
npm run test:control-center  # 10/10 Playwright UI tests
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript no-emit checks
npm run check:syntax         # Node syntax + typecheck + Control Center build
npm run pack                 # electron-builder directory package
```

## Release Truth

| Platform | Status | Public Claim |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| macOS | Validated local baseline and packaged runtime evidence exist; canonical signed/notarized/Gatekeeper evidence capture is scripted and uploaded by release workflow, but real official evidence still needs archive completion | macOS-first release track |
| Windows | Build, signing policy, smoke report, collector, evidence summary, and archive tooling exist; signed artifact evidence and real smoke reports are missing | Do not claim release-ready |
| Linux | Deferred | No support claim |
| Mobile | Out of scope | No support claim |

## Remaining Work

The active product gaps are evidence and ecosystem maturity, not a rewrite of the platform:

1. Run `npm run create-macos-release-evidence-archive` on the macOS release workflow's uploaded evidence artifact for the official signed run and verify passing codesign, notarization, and Gatekeeper evidence through the release archive / signed closure flow.
2. Produce signed Windows artifacts and real Windows smoke reports before changing Windows wording.
3. Fill Windows smoke and native picker smoke evidence from launched or packaged app runs, archive each with its summary and archive manifest, and keep the release archive / signed closure flow pointed at those reviewed archive manifests.
4. Continue toward live independent third-party extension submissions beyond the current `weather-status` local rehearsal and official-repository remote-source rehearsal, while keeping setup execution, language-neutral command execution, creator-tools bridge scope, package-local asset inspection/import limits, dashboard opening support, service start/stop support, manual and opt-in periodic loopback health checks, exit-confirmed stop semantics, bounded host-side force stop, host-owned process-tree fallback limits, maintainer approval role boundaries, and best-effort cleanup limits explicit.
5. Continue TypeScript migration into other high-drift main-process adapter boundaries.

## Documentation Map

- Public entry: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`
- Current handoff: `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- Machine context: `docs/project-context.json`
- Documentation rules: `docs/project-documentation-design.md`
- Release gates: `docs/desktop-release-design.md`, `docs/release-checklist.md`
- Phase audit trail: `docs/phases/`, `docs/reviews/`

## Current Assessment

OpenPet is a mature local desktop platform with strong service separation, broad regression coverage, and conservative security/release wording. The correct next posture is to keep adding evidence and ecosystem proof while preserving the current architecture boundaries.
