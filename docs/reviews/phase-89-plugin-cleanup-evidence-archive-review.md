# Phase 89 Production Code Quality Review

> Reviewer: Codex

> Mode: deep
> Scope: plugin cleanup evidence archive manifest generator, npm script, tests, and docs.

## Scope

- Base: Phase 88 HEAD.
- Scope mode: working tree.
- Changed files reviewed: `scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence-archive-manifest.js`, `tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-archive-manifest.test.js`, `package.json`, Phase 89 docs, and live documentation updates.
- Risk level: medium, because the change generates operator-facing evidence archive manifests and must keep archive validity separate from cleanup readiness.

## Findings

No blocking production issues remain in the Phase 89 diff.

## Review Notes

- Runtime cleanup behavior is unchanged.
- The manifest generator validates cleanup report structure and strict readiness separately.
- The manifest exposes `ok` for archive validity and `cleanupReady` for cleanup readiness.
- Collector helpers are rejected if they contain `--status pass` or omit conservative readiness wording.
- Collected evidence files are hashed recursively.
- Evidence symlinks are rejected and are not accepted as required evidence files.

## Review Fixes

- Fixed a symlink handling issue found during review: required evidence files that are symlinks are no longer read while validating manual checklist or update-command content. A regression test now verifies that symlinked required evidence is rejected and not counted as present.

## Architecture Assessment

The behavior lives in the release/evidence tooling layer and reuses the existing cleanup evidence report validator. It does not add renderer, plugin bridge, runtime cleanup, or filesystem permission surface area.

## Robustness Assessment

Malformed or missing reports, stale collectors, missing evidence files, symlinked evidence files, and pending cleanup checks are all reflected in the manifest without silently claiming readiness. Invalid archives can still write a manifest for operator diagnosis, while the CLI exits non-zero when `ok` is false.

## Test Assessment

Strongest coverage:

- CLI parsing and default archive paths;
- pending archive validity without cleanup readiness;
- missing evidence-file rejection;
- misleading collector pass-shortcut rejection;
- symlink evidence rejection;
- strict all-pass readiness;
- pretty JSON writes.

The remaining gap is true packaged-app cleanup execution. Phase 89 intentionally archives evidence output and does not run packaged cleanup scenarios.

## Quality Gate

- Severe issues: none open.
- Improvement recommendations: future phases can add packaged cleanup execution collectors that produce evidence for this archive shape, while keeping readiness decisions report-driven.
- Quality score: 95/100.
- Pass status: passed.

## Verification

```bash
node --test tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-archive-manifest.test.js
# pass: 9/9
```

```bash
node --test tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-archive-manifest.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-collector.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-report.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-report-update.test.js tests/scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence.test.js
# pass: 40/40
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
# pass
```

```bash
npm run check:syntax
# pass
```

```bash
npm test
# pass: 642/642
```

```bash
npm run test:control-center
# pass: 10/10
```

```bash
git diff --check
# pass
```

```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('node:fs').readFileSync('docs/project-context.json','utf8')); console.log('project-context ok')"
# pass
```

## Final Recommendation

Safe to merge.
