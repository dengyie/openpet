# Phase 90 Production Code Quality Review

> Reviewer: Codex
> Date: 2026-06-18
> Branch: `codex/plugin-cleanup-evidence-runner-phase90`
> Mode: deep
> Scope: packaged plugin cleanup runbook, cleanup evidence collector runner, tests, local evidence archive, and docs.

## Scope

- Base: Phase 89 HEAD.
- Scope mode: working tree.
- Changed files reviewed: `scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-packaged-runbook.js`, `scripts/run-plugin-cleanup-evidence-collector.js`, Phase 90 tests, `package.json`, generated local cleanup evidence archive, Phase 90 docs, and live documentation updates.
- Risk level: medium, because the change executes an evidence collector and could mislead maintainers if execution success were confused with cleanup readiness.

## Findings

No blocking production issues remain in the Phase 90 diff.

## Review Notes

- Runtime cleanup behavior is unchanged.
- The packaged runbook is an operator guide only and does not mark checks as passed.
- The runner creates a pending report, generates the existing Phase 88 collector, executes that collector, records transcripts, and then writes the Phase 89 archive manifest.
- Runner transcripts are stored under `plugin-cleanup-evidence-collected/` so they are included in recursive archive hashes.
- Existing evidence sessions are not overwritten.
- `cleanupReady` remains false until the structured report passes strict readiness validation.

## Review Fixes

- Fixed a missing-file issue found during review: `package.json` and docs referenced the packaged cleanup runbook, but the runbook script and tests were not present in the worktree. Both files are now added and covered by tests.
- Added a default 5-minute collector execution timeout so a stalled helper produces diagnosable failed evidence instead of hanging indefinitely.

## Architecture Assessment

The behavior stays in release/evidence tooling. It composes existing report, collector, and archive-manifest modules rather than adding a new runtime cleanup path. It does not expose additional renderer, plugin, Electron, or filesystem permissions.

## Robustness Assessment

The runner handles collector failures and timeouts by preserving stdout/stderr/run metadata and still writing an invalid archive manifest for diagnosis. Archive validity requires required evidence files. Readiness remains controlled by the structured cleanup report validator.

## Test Assessment

Strongest coverage:

- runner CLI parsing and default session path;
- collector execution environment injection;
- bounded collector timeout metadata;
- stdout/stderr/run transcript persistence;
- successful pending archive creation;
- failed collector preservation without readiness claims;
- overwrite protection;
- packaged runbook content, required checks, and pass-shortcut avoidance.

The remaining gap is true packaged app UI cleanup evidence. Phase 90 gives maintainers the execution chain and operator runbook; it does not automate packaged Control Center setup/command/service cleanup scenarios.

## Quality Gate

- Severe issues: none open.
- Improvement recommendations: future work can add packaged app UI automation for setup, declaration-command, and service cleanup flows, then update reports from reviewed evidence.
- Quality score: 95/100.
- Pass status: passed.

## Verification

```bash
node --test tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-runner.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-packaged-runbook.test.js
# pass: 15/15
```

```bash
node --test tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-runner.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-packaged-runbook.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-archive-manifest.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-collector.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-report.test.js tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-report-update.test.js tests/scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence.test.js
# pass: 57/57
```

```bash
npm run run-plugin-cleanup-evidence-collector -- --archive-dir docs/release-evidence/plugin-cleanup-evidence/2026-06-18T14-30-00Z-darwin-arm64 --host-app "OpenPet packaged cleanup evidence rehearsal" --notes "Phase 90 local execution rehearsal"
# archive valid: yes
# plugin cleanup ready: no
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
# pass
```

```bash
npm run check:syntax
# pass
```

```bash
npm test
# pass: 659/659
```

```bash
npm run test:control-center
# pass: 10/10
```

```bash
git diff --check
# pass
```

```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('node:fs').readFileSync('docs/project-context.json','utf8')); console.log('project-context ok')"
# pass
```

## Final Recommendation

Safe to merge.
