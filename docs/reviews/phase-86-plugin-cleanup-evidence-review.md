# Phase 86 Production Code Quality Review

> Reviewer: Codex
> Date: 2026-06-18
> Branch: `codex/plugin-cleanup-evidence-phase86`
> Mode: deep
> Scope: plugin cleanup evidence command, structured cleanup report creation/validation, contracts, archived evidence, tests, and docs.

## Scope

- Base: Phase 85 HEAD.
- Scope mode: working tree.
- Changed files reviewed: `scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence.js`, `scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence-report.js`, `scripts/validate-plugin-cleanup-evidence-report.js`, `package.json`, shared contracts, Phase 86 tests/docs, archived cleanup evidence, and live documentation updates.
- Risk level: medium-high, because the phase touches local process cleanup evidence and could mislead maintainers if readiness wording is too broad.

## Findings

No blocking production issues found in the Phase 86 diff.

## Review Notes

- Runtime cleanup behavior is unchanged. The phase adds evidence commands and validators only.
- The automatic evidence command starts a controlled root/descendant fixture and targets only that owned process tree.
- The command refuses to overwrite existing evidence JSON/Markdown files.
- The structured checklist validator rejects missing, duplicate, unknown, non-passing, and evidence-free passed checks before cleanup readiness can be claimed.
- Pending reports require `--allow-pending`, keeping in-progress evidence distinct from readiness evidence.
- All report wording preserves the non-universal process-tree cleanup boundary.

## Architecture Assessment

The split is appropriate: `service-process-tree` remains the cleanup primitive, `PluginService` remains untouched, and scripts own evidence generation/validation. Shared contracts cover both the controlled fixture report and the checklist report shapes, reducing future evidence/report drift.

## Robustness Assessment

The controlled fixture has bounded waits and a final best-effort `SIGKILL` cleanup for its own root and descendant PIDs. The checklist validator is intentionally strict for readiness mode and tolerant only when `--allow-pending` is explicit.

## Test Assessment

Strongest coverage:

- actual controlled host cleanup fixture generation;
- overwrite refusal;
- conservative Markdown wording;
- pending versus readiness validation;
- evidence requirement for passed checks;
- unknown, duplicate, and missing check rejection;
- shared TypeScript fixtures for both report shapes.

The remaining evidence gap is broader packaged-app cleanup evidence against real plugin entries. Phase 86 creates the tooling and one controlled macOS host fixture; it does not claim broader packaged cleanup readiness.

## Quality Gate

- Severe issues: none open.
- Improvement recommendations: future cleanup work can add packaged-app collectors or CI artifact upload, but should keep them separate from runtime cleanup semantics.
- Quality score: 94/100.
- Pass status: passed.

## Verification

```bash
node --test tests/release/plugin-cleanup-evidence-report.test.js
# pass: 6/6
```

```bash
node --test tests/scripts/create-plugin-cleanup-evidence.test.js
# pass: 5/5
```

```bash
npm run typecheck
# pass
```

```bash
npm run check:syntax
# pass
```

```bash
npm test
# pass: 614/614
```

```bash
npm run test:control-center
# pass: 10/10
```

## Final Recommendation

Safe to merge.
