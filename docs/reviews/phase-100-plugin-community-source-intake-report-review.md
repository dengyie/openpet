## Review Setup

- Mode: `checkpoint`
- Change type: tooling and documentation
- Risk level: medium, because the change affects maintainer provenance decisions and external-source compatibility messaging rather than runtime execution.

## Findings

No blocking issues found in the Phase 100 diff.

The intake report cleanly separates candidate-source compatibility triage from the existing submission/approval evidence flow. That avoids overstating ecosystem support when a public repository belongs to a neighboring package model rather than the current OpenPet `plugin.json` model.

## Improvement Suggestions

- When a confirmed independent third-party OpenPet plugin repository becomes available, archive one successful Phase 100 intake session and then route it through Phase 99 so the docs can point at a real green-path external sample instead of only compatibility tooling.
- If maintainers later need a richer intake matrix, add explicit reason codes for cases like `plugin-json-invalid`, `unsafe-archive`, or `review-policy-mismatch` instead of widening free-form notes.

## Correctness Assessment

Strong points:

- public source URL and archive URL both require HTTPS;
- compatible and incompatible candidate archives both produce structured evidence;
- a missing `plugin.json` no longer aborts the run before provenance is archived;
- compatible candidates are validated through the existing package validator instead of a weaker duplicate check;
- the README/checklist language stays conservative and does not claim trust, publication, or runtime safety.

## Robustness Assessment

The implementation reuses the established archive download/extract safety patterns while intentionally not reusing the full Phase 76/99 success path. That is the right split for this problem because incompatible candidate sources need an auditable report instead of an exception.

## Test Assessment

Covered by tests:

- CLI argument parsing;
- compatible archive path producing `ready-for-community-evidence`;
- incompatible archive path producing `incompatible-package-model`;
- conservative README wording for non-compatible sources.

No blocking missing test remains for this tooling slice.

## Final Recommendation

Safe to merge
