# ibot Ecosystem Catalog

`catalog/ibot-catalog.json` is the first productized catalog format for plugins and pet packs. It is a static JSON file bundled with the app. Future marketplace backends should emit the same shape so the Control Center and `CatalogService` do not need a new trust model.

## Rules

- Catalog entries are metadata only. They never execute code.
- Downloadable entries must include both `packageUrl` and `sha256`.
- `packageUrl` must use HTTPS.
- Downloaded bytes must match `sha256` before inspection or installation starts.
- Plugins still go through `PluginInstallService` review before install/update.
- Pet packs still go through `PetPackService.inspectPackDirectory()` before import.
- Local blocklist entries are stored in `settings.ecosystem.blocklist` and can be managed in Control Center → Catalog.

## Blocklist

Blocklist checks are applied in four places:

- catalog prepare/install for plugins and pet packs
- manual plugin install/update
- plugin enable/run
- pet pack import/activate

`sha256` may match either the downloaded package hash or the installed content hash, depending on how the item entered the system.
