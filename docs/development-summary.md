> Current release track: `v1.0.1-rc.2`

This is the short engineering summary for the current repository state. For long phase history, read `docs/phases/` and `docs/reviews/`. For support claims and documentation rules, read `docs/project-documentation-design.md`.
For the latest phase execution design, read `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`. For current platform status, read `docs/project-status-review.md`.

## Current State

OpenPet is now a desktop pet platform with:

- an Electron pet window,
- a React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack import and bundled pet packs,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- developer-first local extension docs with explicit `entries.setup` execution, language-neutral explicit `entries.commands` process execution, explicit command result feedback, short-lived command bridge access, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, explicit loopback service health checks, host-managed periodic service health policy for running services, broader host-owned process-tree fallback cleanup for explicit local-process stops, structured maintainer approval rehearsal artifacts for submission bundles, existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal evidence, and remote-source submission rehearsal evidence,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP endpoints,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC, Control Center view contracts, the Control Center API facade, Control Center hook state boundaries, Control Center pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative product payload fixtures.

## Current Capability Summary

- Pet packs: Codex pet directory/zip import, bundled `doro`, `duodong`, `chispa`, export, provenance, and version-conflict review.
- AI: OpenAI-compatible chat, main-process secret storage, behavior decisions, replay, redacted diagnostics export, and clear-history controls.
- Extensions: current legacy SDK examples, validation, submission bundles, scaffold author rehearsal, existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal, remote-source submission rehearsal, maintainer approval rehearsal, developer-first local extension docs, normalized `entries` declarations including explicit `entries.setup` execution, `entries.commands` support through the existing JavaScript compatibility runner and explicit short-lived process execution for declaration-only local extensions, command result feedback in Control Center, short-lived command bridge access for `pet.say` / `pet.action` / `pet.event` / read-only context, Control Center declaration visibility, explicit HTTP/HTTPS dashboard opening, explicit `entries.services` start/stop with runtime status and logs, manual loopback-only health checks, opt-in host-managed periodic health checks for running services, best-effort process-group cleanup on service stop, exit-confirmed setup/command/service stop semantics, bounded host-side force stop for stubborn services, host-owned process-tree fallback cleanup across explicit service/setup/declaration-command stop paths, and separate maintainer approval artifacts beside ready-for-review submission bundles. Command, setup, and service processes are spawned without shell expansion; setup and command entries never run during install or enable, services do not auto-start, approval remains a human review decision, and universal process-tree guarantees remain future runtime work.
- Release evidence: packaged runtime smoke runner, stricter runtime/picker evidence-link validation, desktop picker evidence summary/archive manifest tooling, macOS codesign/notarization/Gatekeeper evidence capture with GitHub Actions artifact upload and permanent artifact archive handoff, release archive manifest tooling that now requires the picker archive manifest, and signed release closure reporting without unsupported readiness claims.
- TypeScript: shared IPC/view contracts, typed Control Center API facade, typed Control Center hook state boundaries, typed Control Center pane prop surfaces, `@ts-check` main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative payload fixtures in `npm run typecheck`.

## Validation Baseline

```bash
npm test                     # 557/557 Node tests
npm run test:control-center  # 10/10 Playwright UI tests
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript no-emit checks
npm run check:syntax         # Node syntax + typecheck + Control Center build
```

## Open Work

- Windows is still not release-ready until real signed installer evidence and smoke reports are archived.
- Packaged native picker and signed release archive evidence still need real archived runs; automated macOS packaged runtime evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/packaged-runtime/2026-06-16T14-52-13-074Z-darwin-arm64/`, Phase 65 requires packaged runtime readiness to link the paired desktop picker report before archive readiness can be claimed, Phase 66 adds desktop picker evidence summary/archive manifest tooling for the reviewed picker archive, Phase 67 requires the release archive and signed closure flow to consume that picker archive manifest, Phase 77 adds a repeatable macOS evidence capture command for the canonical codesign/notarization/Gatekeeper files, Phase 78 uploads those macOS evidence files as a dedicated release workflow artifact, and Phase 79 copies downloaded workflow evidence into a permanent archive with provenance and hashes.
- Signed release closure evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/signed-release-closure/2026-06-16T15-00-00Z/` and currently records official desktop, macOS, and Windows claims as `not-ready`.
- Extension author rehearsal evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/plugin-author-rehearsal/2026-06-16T16-00-00Z/` with minimal, network, storage, and AI-assisted legacy SDK scaffolds, a validated submission bundle, and a separate maintainer approval rehearsal record.
- Existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/plugin-real-world-submission-rehearsal/2026-06-17T15-14-15Z/` using `examples/plugins/weather-status` with package, submission bundle, and maintainer approval artifacts.
- Remote-source submission rehearsal evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/plugin-remote-source-submission-rehearsal/2026-06-18T00-30-00Z/` using `https://codeload.github.com/dengyie/OpenPet/zip/refs/heads/main` with archive URL, final URL, archive SHA-256, archive size, selected plugin path, extracted file hashes, package, submission bundle, and maintainer approval artifacts.
- The extension ecosystem now has fifteen runtime-backed slices of the target model: enabled policy-allowed local plugins can explicitly run declared setup entries, `entries.commands` can feed the existing JavaScript compatibility runner when a package still provides `main`, declaration-only local `entries.commands` can run as explicit short-lived processes with JSON stdin context, declaration-only local command runs can use short-lived bridge calls for `pet.say` / `pet.action` / `pet.event` / read-only context, enabled plugins can explicitly open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards from Control Center, enabled local plugins can explicitly start/stop declared service entries with logs and runtime state, declared loopback service health endpoints can be checked manually, running services can receive opt-in host-managed periodic health checks, setup/command/service stops now keep stop intent visible until exit confirmation, service stops attempt best-effort process-group cleanup, stubborn services now trigger a bounded force-stop attempt, service cleanup now uses a host-owned process-tree fallback when process-group signalling fails, setup and declaration-only command cleanup now try the same host-owned tree cleanup before direct child kill fallback, and command/setup/service processes avoid shell expansion.
- Phase 75 is now complete: an existing example plugin can now run through a local package -> submission bundle -> maintainer approval rehearsal, while the archive remains workflow evidence rather than external community provenance or release trust.
- Phase 76 is now complete: a public HTTPS archive plugin snapshot can now run through remote-source provenance -> package -> submission bundle -> maintainer approval rehearsal, while the archive remains remote-source workflow evidence rather than proof of independent public ecosystem trust.
- Phase 77 is now complete: macOS release operators can capture or import canonical codesign, notarization, and Gatekeeper evidence files plus summary output, while official macOS readiness still depends on real passing signed evidence.
- Phase 78 is now complete: macOS release workflow runs upload a separate `openpet-macos-release-evidence-<tag>` artifact while keeping those evidence files out of public release downloads.
- Phase 79 is now complete: downloaded macOS workflow evidence artifacts can be archived permanently with `npm run create-macos-release-evidence-archive`, while official release readiness remains gated by release archive and signed closure reports.

## Next Engineering Steps

1. Use `npm run create-macos-release-evidence-archive` to copy the next signed macOS workflow's `openpet-macos-release-evidence-<tag>` artifact into a permanent release archive, then produce real signed release and Windows smoke evidence before changing platform wording.
2. Fill native picker evidence from launched or packaged app runs, archive it with `npm run create-desktop-picker-evidence-summary` and `npm run create-desktop-picker-archive-manifest`, then feed that archive into the release-level manifest and closure report.
3. Continue signed evidence/report hardening or gather live external community submission evidence beyond the current official-repository remote-source rehearsal.
4. Keep `npm start` functional and keep user-facing configuration in Control Center.
