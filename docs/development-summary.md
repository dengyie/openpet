# OpenPet Development Summary

> Last updated: 2026-06-17

> Current release track: `v1.0.1-rc.2`

This is the short engineering summary for the current repository state. For long phase history, read `docs/phases/` and `docs/reviews/`. For support claims and documentation rules, read `docs/project-documentation-design.md`.
For the latest phase execution design, read `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`. For current platform status, read `docs/project-status-review.md`.

## Current State

OpenPet is now a desktop pet platform with:

- an Electron pet window,
- a React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack import and bundled pet packs,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- developer-first local extension docs with explicit `entries.setup` execution, language-neutral explicit `entries.commands` process execution, explicit command result feedback, short-lived command/service bridge access with read-only action discovery, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, explicit loopback service health checks, and exit-confirmed service stop semantics,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP endpoints,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC, Control Center view contracts, the Control Center API facade, Control Center hook state boundaries, Control Center pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative product payload fixtures.

## Current Capability Summary

- Pet packs: Codex pet directory/zip import, bundled `doro`, `duodong`, `chispa`, export, provenance, and version-conflict review.
- AI: OpenAI-compatible chat, main-process secret storage, behavior decisions, replay, redacted diagnostics export, and clear-history controls.
- Extensions: current legacy SDK examples, validation, submission bundles, author rehearsal, developer-first local extension docs, normalized `entries` declarations including explicit `entries.setup` execution, `entries.commands` support through the existing JavaScript compatibility runner and explicit short-lived process execution for declaration-only local extensions, command result feedback in Control Center, short-lived bridge access for explicit commands and services for `pet.say` / `pet.action` / `pet.event` / read-only context / read-only action discovery, Control Center declaration visibility, explicit HTTP/HTTPS dashboard opening, explicit `entries.services` start/stop with runtime status and logs, manual loopback-only health checks, and exit-confirmed best-effort service cleanup on stop. Command, setup, and service processes are spawned without shell expansion; setup and command entries never run during install or enable, services do not auto-start, and hard process-tree guarantees remain future runtime work.
- Release evidence: packaged runtime smoke runner, release archive manifest tooling, and signed release closure reporting without unsupported readiness claims.
- TypeScript: shared IPC/view contracts, typed Control Center API facade, typed Control Center hook state boundaries, typed Control Center pane prop surfaces, `@ts-check` main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative payload fixtures in `npm run typecheck`.

## Validation Baseline

```bash
npm test
npm run test:control-center  # 10/10 Playwright UI tests
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript no-emit checks
npm run check:syntax         # Node syntax + typecheck + Control Center build
```

## Open Work

- Windows is still not release-ready until real signed installer evidence and smoke reports are archived.
- Packaged native picker and signed release archive evidence still need real archived runs; automated macOS packaged runtime evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/packaged-runtime/2026-06-16T14-52-13-074Z-darwin-arm64/`.
- Signed release closure evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/signed-release-closure/2026-06-16T15-00-00Z/` and currently records official desktop, macOS, and Windows claims as `not-ready`.
- Extension author rehearsal evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/plugin-author-rehearsal/2026-06-16T16-00-00Z/` with minimal, network, storage, and AI-assisted legacy SDK scaffolds plus a validated submission bundle.
- The extension ecosystem now has twelve runtime-backed slices of the target model: enabled policy-allowed local plugins can explicitly run declared setup entries, `entries.commands` can feed the existing JavaScript compatibility runner when a package still provides `main`, declaration-only local `entries.commands` can run as explicit short-lived processes with JSON stdin context, declaration-only local command runs can use short-lived bridge calls for `pet.say` / `pet.action` / `pet.event` / read-only context / read-only action discovery, enabled plugins can explicitly open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards from Control Center, enabled local plugins can explicitly start/stop declared service entries with logs and runtime state, explicitly started services can use the same narrow bridge for pet-aware behavior, bounded context, and read-only action discovery, declared loopback service health endpoints can be checked manually, service stops stay `stopping` until exit confirmation after best-effort process-group cleanup attempts, and command/setup/service processes avoid shell expansion.
- After Phase 67, the next planning step is real evidence work, community extension rehearsal, harder descendant-process guarantees, or another high-drift service/report boundary.

## Next Engineering Steps

1. Produce real signed release and Windows smoke evidence before changing platform wording.
2. Fill native picker evidence from launched or packaged app runs.
3. Decide whether the next extension phase should implement another narrow bridge capability after read-only action discovery, periodic health policy, stronger descendant-process cleanup guarantees, or continue evidence/report hardening.
4. Keep `npm start` functional and keep user-facing configuration in Control Center.
