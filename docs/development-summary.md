# OpenPet Development Summary

> Current release track: `v1.0.1-rc.2`

This is the short engineering summary for the current repository state. For long phase history, read `docs/phases/` and `docs/reviews/`. For support claims and documentation rules, read `docs/project-documentation-design.md`.
For the latest phase execution design, read `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`. For current platform status, read `docs/project-status-review.md`.

## Current State

OpenPet is now a desktop pet platform with:

- an Electron pet window,
- a React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack import and bundled pet packs,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- developer-first local extension docs with explicit `entries.setup` execution, language-neutral explicit `entries.commands` process execution, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, and explicit loopback service health checks,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP endpoints,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC, Control Center view contracts, the Control Center API facade, Control Center hook state boundaries, Control Center pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative product payload fixtures.

## Current Capability Summary

- Pet packs: Codex pet directory/zip import, bundled `doro`, `duodong`, `chispa`, export, provenance, and version-conflict review.
- AI: OpenAI-compatible chat, main-process secret storage, behavior decisions, replay, redacted diagnostics export, and clear-history controls.
- Extensions: current legacy SDK examples, validation, submission bundles, author rehearsal, developer-first local extension docs, normalized `entries` declarations including explicit `entries.setup` execution, `entries.commands` support through the existing JavaScript compatibility runner and explicit short-lived process execution for declaration-only local extensions, Control Center declaration visibility, explicit HTTP/HTTPS dashboard opening, explicit `entries.services` start/stop with runtime status and logs, manual loopback-only health checks, and best-effort process-group cleanup on service stop. Command, setup, and service processes are spawned without shell expansion; setup and command entries never run during install or enable, services do not auto-start, and hard process-tree guarantees and bridge flows remain future runtime work.
- Release evidence: packaged runtime smoke runner, release archive manifest tooling, and signed release closure reporting without unsupported readiness claims.
- TypeScript: shared IPC/view contracts, typed Control Center API facade, typed Control Center hook state boundaries, typed Control Center pane prop surfaces, `@ts-check` main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative payload fixtures in `npm run typecheck`.

## Validation Baseline

```bash
npm test                     # 465/465 Node tests
npm run test:control-center  # 10/10 Playwright UI tests
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript no-emit checks
npm run check:syntax         # Node syntax + typecheck + Control Center build
```

## Open Work

- Windows is still not release-ready until real signed installer evidence and smoke reports are archived.
- Packaged native picker and signed release archive evidence still need real archived runs; automated macOS packaged runtime evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/packaged-runtime/2026-06-16T14-52-13-074Z-darwin-arm64/`.
- Signed release closure evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/signed-release-closure/2026-06-16T15-00-00Z/` and currently records official desktop, macOS, and Windows claims as `not-ready`.
- Extension author rehearsal evidence is archived under `docs/release-evidence/plugin-author-rehearsal/2026-06-16T16-00-00Z/` with minimal, network, storage, and AI-assisted legacy SDK scaffolds plus a validated submission bundle.
- The extension ecosystem now has eight runtime-backed slices of the target model: enabled policy-allowed local plugins can explicitly run declared setup entries, `entries.commands` can feed the existing JavaScript compatibility runner when a package still provides `main`, declaration-only local `entries.commands` can run as explicit short-lived processes with JSON stdin context, enabled plugins can explicitly open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards from Control Center, enabled local plugins can explicitly start/stop declared service entries with logs and runtime state, declared loopback service health endpoints can be checked manually, service stops attempt best-effort process-group cleanup, and command/setup/service processes avoid shell expansion.
- After Phase 62, the next planning step is bridge integration, real evidence work, community extension rehearsal, hard process-tree guarantees, richer command result UX, or another high-drift service/report boundary.

## Next Engineering Steps

1. Produce real signed release and Windows smoke evidence before changing platform wording.
2. Fill native picker evidence from launched or packaged app runs.
3. Decide whether the next extension phase should implement bridge integration, periodic health policy, hard process-tree cleanup guarantees, richer command result UX, or continue evidence/report hardening.
4. Keep `npm start` functional and keep user-facing configuration in Control Center.
