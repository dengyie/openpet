# OpenPet Extension Submission Workflow Playbook

This playbook turns the existing Phase 23-27 submission commands into a single end-to-end rehearsal path for third-party extension authors. The commands still use the historical "plugin" name for compatibility, but the target ecosystem model is extension-first.

## 1. What This Is

Use this playbook when you want to rehearse an extension submission locally before opening a PR or handing a package to a reviewer.

It covers:

- preflight validation of the extension package
- generation of the reviewer report
- generation of the PR packet
- generation of the full submission bundle
- validation of the generated bundle before review
- recording and validating a separate maintainer approval artifact after review
- one-command existing-plugin rehearsal for a more realistic local submission path

It does not:

- install, enable, update, or run extension code
- establish signing trust
- approve publication
- replace manual reviewer judgment

## 2. One-Command Author Rehearsal

For the complete Phase 44 author path, run:

```bash
npm run create-plugin-author-rehearsal -- --output-dir docs/release-evidence/plugin-author-rehearsal/<session> --submission-template ai
```

This creates minimal, network, storage, and AI-assisted legacy scaffolds; validates every scaffold; packages the selected extension as `.openpet-plugin.zip`; creates a submission bundle; validates the bundle with `--require-ready`; and writes an author README, command list, checklist, and machine-readable summary.

The generated bundle is still an author-to-reviewer handoff packet. It does not install, enable, run, approve, sign, or publish the extension.

For a local existing-plugin rehearsal, run:

```bash
npm run create-plugin-real-world-submission-rehearsal -- --source examples/plugins/weather-status --output-dir docs/release-evidence/plugin-real-world-submission-rehearsal/<session>
```

This validates and packages an already-authored example plugin, creates a submission bundle, records maintainer approval, and writes local evidence files. It is closer to real contributor behavior than scaffold rehearsal, but it still does not prove external community provenance.

## 3. Manual Rehearsal Order

Start from a generated local extension or a tested legacy example such as `examples/plugins/focus-timer`.

```bash
npm run create-openpet-plugin -- "My Plugin" --template minimal --output-dir scratch/plugins
npm run validate:plugin -- scratch/plugins/openpet.plugin.my-plugin
npm run validate:plugin -- examples/plugins/focus-timer
npm run create-plugin-submission-report -- examples/plugins/focus-timer --output plugin-submission-report.md
npm run create-plugin-submission-pr -- examples/plugins/focus-timer --output plugin-submission-pr.md
npm run create-plugin-submission-bundle -- examples/plugins/focus-timer --output-dir plugin-submission-bundle
npm run validate-plugin-submission-bundle -- plugin-submission-bundle --require-ready
npm run create-plugin-maintainer-approval -- plugin-submission-bundle --reviewer "OpenPet Maintainer" --decision approved --notes "Manifest, permissions, package hash, and submission artifacts reviewed."
npm run validate-plugin-maintainer-approval -- plugin-submission-bundle --require-approved
```

If the bundle is blocked before human review, fix the package or signature issue first, then rerun the bundle and validator commands.
If the maintainer decision is `changes-requested`, keep the approval files as review evidence but do not treat the bundle as maintainer-approved.

Current validation may still reject legacy SDK config fields that look like secrets, such as `apiKey`, `accessToken`, `password`, `credential`, `format: "password"`, or `writeOnly: true`. Under the extension boundary, treat that as a current tooling limitation for OpenPet-managed config: disclose extension-owned secrets in `manifest`, keep them in extension-managed files or setup flows, and avoid implying that OpenPet controls every credential.

## 4. What Each Artifact Means

- `plugin-submission-report.md`: reviewer-facing validation report
- `plugin-submission-pr.md`: PR body template with checklist and review notes
- `plugin-submission-summary.json`: machine-readable bundle summary
- `plugin-maintainer-approval.md`: human-readable maintainer approval record
- `plugin-maintainer-approval.json`: machine-readable maintainer approval record

The summary should confirm:

- the source path
- the output bundle directory
- the ready-for-human-review decision
- the extension identity
- the package hash
- the signature state

## 5. Reviewer Handoff

When the author rehearsal succeeds:

1. Attach or paste `plugin-submission-report.md` into the extension PR.
2. Use `plugin-submission-pr.md` as the PR body or starting point.
3. Include the bundle directory if the reviewer wants the machine-readable summary.
4. Record the maintainer approval separately:

```bash
npm run create-plugin-maintainer-approval -- plugin-submission-bundle --reviewer "OpenPet Maintainer" --decision approved --notes "Manifest, permissions, package hash, and submission artifacts reviewed."
npm run validate-plugin-maintainer-approval -- plugin-submission-bundle --require-approved
```

The approval record is a human review artifact. It does not establish signing trust, catalog publication, runtime safety, or release readiness.

## 6. Common Failure Patterns

- `validate:plugin` fails: fix manifest, signature metadata, blocklist, current compatibility checks, or package safety issues first.
- `create-plugin-submission-bundle` exits non-zero: the package is not ready for human review yet.
- `validate-plugin-submission-bundle --require-ready` fails: check the bundle summary decision and repair the underlying package or signature issue.
- `create-plugin-maintainer-approval` exits non-zero: the submission bundle is malformed, the maintainer metadata is incomplete, or the generated record is not approval-ready.
- `validate-plugin-maintainer-approval --require-approved` fails: the approval artifact is missing, mismatched, malformed, or the submission bundle was not ready for human review.

## 7. Why This Exists

The project already had command-level documentation for validation, report generation, PR packets, bundle generation, and bundle validation. This playbook gives third-party authors a single rehearsal path they can follow without stitching the steps together themselves, while the runtime and tooling migrate from the legacy plugin SDK toward the unified extension model.
