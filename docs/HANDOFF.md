# OpenPet Handoff

> Last updated: 2026-06-16 | Branch: `main`

## Current Snapshot

OpenPet is a desktop pet platform with:

- Electron pet window runtime,
- React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack runtime with Codex pet import and zip import,
- bundled built-in packs `doro`, `duodong`, and `chispa`,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- permission-limited plugins,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC and Control Center view contracts.

## Read First

1. [`docs/project-documentation-design.md`](./project-documentation-design.md)
2. [`docs/development-summary.md`](./development-summary.md)
3. [`docs/project-context.json`](./project-context.json)
4. [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)
5. [`docs/release-checklist.md`](./release-checklist.md)
6. [`docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`](./productization-v1.1-todo-design.md)
7. [`docs/productization-next-steps-design.md`](./productization-next-steps-design.md)
8. [`docs/productization-todo-design.md`](./productization-todo-design.md)

## Facts To Preserve

- `PetService` remains the single source of truth for pet state.
- New user-facing configuration belongs in Control Center.
- API keys must stay out of the renderer and ordinary plugins.
- Plugins keep permission review and isolation.
- `cat_anime/` structure is unchanged.
- Windows is not release-ready yet.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm start
npm run dev:control-center
npm test
npm run test:control-center
npm run typecheck
npm run check:syntax
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-runbook
npm run validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-release-evidence-archive-manifest
```

## Where To Look For Detail

- `docs/phases/` for phase records.
- `docs/reviews/` for phase review notes.
- `docs/project-status-review.md` for longer evaluation.
- `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` for the Phase 38+ TODO design.
- `docs/productization-todo-design.md` for the prioritized TODO implementation design.
- `docs/desktop-release-design.md` for desktop release evidence.
- `scripts/create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js` and `scripts/validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js` for packaged app runtime evidence.
- `scripts/create-release-evidence-archive-manifest.js` for release-level evidence archive validation.
- `docs/plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md` for plugin onboarding.

## Next Steps

1. Use `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` as the near-term execution entry for the next productization phases.
2. Fill real packaged runtime, picker, and signed archive evidence before claiming packaged runtime or release readiness.
3. Continue TypeScript migration from shared IPC and Control Center view contracts into the API facade, hooks, and main-process boundaries.
