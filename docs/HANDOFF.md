# OpenPet Handoff

> Last updated: 2026-06-18 | Branch: `codex/macos-release-evidence-archive-phase79`

## Current Snapshot

OpenPet is a desktop pet platform with:

- Electron pet window runtime,
- React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack runtime with Codex pet import and zip import,
- bundled built-in packs `doro`, `duodong`, and `chispa`,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- AI behavior decisions with Control Center replay and redacted diagnostics,
- developer-first local extension docs with explicit `entries.setup` execution, language-neutral explicit `entries.commands` process execution, explicit command result feedback, explicit command bridge access, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, explicit loopback service health checks, host-managed periodic service health policy for running services, best-effort service process-group cleanup, exit-confirmed setup/command/service stop semantics, bounded host-side force stop for stubborn services, host-owned process-tree fallback cleanup across service/setup/declaration-command stop paths, plugin submission bundles, scaffold author rehearsal, maintainer approval rehearsal records, existing-plugin real-world submission rehearsal evidence, and remote-source submission rehearsal evidence,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC, Control Center view contracts, the Control Center API facade, Control Center hook state boundaries, Control Center pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative payload fixtures.

## Read First

1. [`docs/development-summary.md`](./development-summary.md)
2. [`docs/project-context.json`](./project-context.json)
3. [`docs/project-status-review.md`](./project-status-review.md)
4. [`docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`](./productization-v1.1-todo-design.md)
5. [`docs/project-documentation-design.md`](./project-documentation-design.md)

## Facts To Preserve

- `PetService` remains the single source of truth for pet state.
- New user-facing configuration belongs in Control Center.
- API keys must stay out of the renderer.
- Extension docs must be honest: OpenPet now parses declarations, can explicitly run `entries.setup` for enabled policy-allowed local plugins, can run `entries.commands` through the JavaScript compatibility runner when `main` exists, can explicitly run declaration-only local `entries.commands` as short-lived processes with JSON stdin context, can inject short-lived bridge URL/token env vars for those declaration-only command runs, can explicitly open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards for enabled plugins, can explicitly start/stop declared local service entries, can manually check declared loopback service health endpoints, can host-manage periodic health checks for running services through Control Center, attempts best-effort process-group cleanup when stopping service entries, only reports setup/command/service stop completion after child exit confirmation, will attempt one bounded host-side force stop if the service ignores the grace-period stop request, and now tries a host-owned process-tree fallback before direct child kill across service/setup/declaration-command stop paths. Submission bundles can now also receive a separate structured maintainer approval record. Approval remains a human review decision and not signing trust, catalog publication, runtime safety, or release readiness proof. Command, setup, and service processes are spawned without shell expansion. Services do not auto-start, setup and command entries do not run during install or enable, background checks stay opt-in and runtime-bound, universal process-tree cleanup guarantees are not implemented, and OpenPet does not claim complete sandboxing for arbitrary local processes.
- `cat_anime/` structure is unchanged.
- Windows is not release-ready yet.

## Where To Look For Detail

- `docs/phases/` for phase records.
- `docs/reviews/` for phase review notes.
- `docs/project-status-review.md` for longer evaluation.
- `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` for the Phase 38+ execution design.
- `docs/project-review-todo-design.md` for the consolidated whole-project review TODO design.
- `docs/productization-todo-design.md` for the prioritized TODO implementation design.
- `docs/desktop-release-design.md` for desktop release evidence.
- `docs/plugin-sandbox-evaluation.md` for current plugin runner guarantees, limits, and v1.1 recommendation.
- `scripts/run-packaged-runtime-smoke.js`, `scripts/create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js`, and `scripts/validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js` for packaged app runtime evidence.
- `scripts/create-desktop-picker-evidence-summary.js` and `scripts/create-desktop-picker-archive-manifest.js` for reviewed native picker evidence archive summaries and manifests.
- `scripts/create-release-evidence-archive-manifest.js` and `scripts/create-signed-release-closure-report.js` for release-level evidence archive validation and release-claim closure.

## Next Steps

1. Use the archived Phase 43 signed release closure report as the current release-claim gate: official desktop, macOS, and Windows release readiness remain `not-ready` until signed evidence and platform smoke reports are complete.
2. Use Phase 64 plugin command bridge as the current plugin-command boundary: command entries still run only from an explicit Control Center action on enabled policy-allowed local plugins, and declaration-only command runs now get a short-lived bridge URL/token for `pet.say`, `pet.action`, `pet.event`, and read-only context.
3. Use Phase 65 release evidence link closure as the current runtime/picker evidence boundary: packaged runtime reports must link the paired desktop picker report before they can claim readiness, and archive release readiness now fails when that link is missing or mismatched.
4. Use Phase 66 desktop picker evidence archive tooling when a packaged native picker run is collected: generate the summary, create the archive manifest, and only claim readiness when the filled report and archive both pass.
5. Use Phase 67 release picker archive link closure as the current release-claim boundary: release-level archive manifests and signed closure wording now explicitly require the reviewed desktop picker archive manifest to match the archived picker report.
6. Use Phase 73 cleanup hardening plus Phase 72 service process-tree fallback, Phase 71 periodic health policy, Phase 70 setup/command cleanup parity, and Phase 69 plugin service force stop as the current extension cleanup/health boundary: setup, declaration-only command, and service stop requests now keep stop intent visible until child exit confirmation, setup and declaration-only commands now try host-owned process-tree cleanup before direct child kill fallback, only service entries add the bounded host-side force-stop path, and only running services can receive opt-in periodic health checks.
7. Use Phase 74 maintainer approval rehearsal as the current extension review-handoff boundary: author rehearsal stops at a ready-for-human-review submission bundle, maintainer approval is recorded as a separate Markdown/JSON artifact, and approval remains explicit human judgment rather than automated trust or publication.
8. Use Phase 54 Release Evidence Contracts plus Phase 64 plugin entry/setup/command/dashboard/service contracts as the current TypeScript migration baseline.
9. Use Phase 75 real-world submission rehearsal as the current existing-plugin submission baseline: `examples/plugins/weather-status` now has an archived local package -> submission bundle -> maintainer approval evidence chain, but that archive still does not prove external community provenance, signing trust, catalog publication, runtime safety, or release readiness.
10. Use Phase 76 remote-source rehearsal as the current source-review baseline: `https://codeload.github.com/dengyie/OpenPet/zip/refs/heads/main` now has an archived HTTPS archive -> extracted plugin -> submission bundle -> maintainer approval evidence chain that records archive URL, final URL, archive SHA-256, archive size, selected plugin path, and extracted file hashes, but it still does not prove independent public community ownership, signing trust, catalog publication, runtime safety, or release readiness.
11. Use Phase 77 macOS release evidence capture as the current signed-evidence collection path: the helper can archive `macos-codesign.txt`, `macos-notarization.txt`, `macos-gatekeeper.txt`, and Markdown/JSON summaries, but official readiness remains false until real signed, notarized, Gatekeeper-accepted evidence is present.
12. Use Phase 78 macOS release evidence artifact upload as the current release-workflow evidence boundary: macOS release jobs upload `openpet-macos-release-evidence-<tag>` as a maintainer artifact, while public GitHub Release assets stay limited to install/update files.
13. Use Phase 79 macOS release evidence archive tooling as the current long-term artifact retention boundary: downloaded workflow evidence can be copied into a permanent archive with provenance and hashes, but it still does not prove official release readiness by itself.
14. After Phase 79, continue from collecting real signed workflow artifacts, live external community submission evidence, stronger cleanup evidence on real hosts, or another high-drift service/report boundary.
