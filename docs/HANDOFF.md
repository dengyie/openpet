# OpenPet Handoff

> Last updated: 2026-06-16 | Branch: `main`

## Current Snapshot

OpenPet is a desktop pet platform with:

- Electron pet window runtime,
- React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack runtime with Codex pet import and zip import,
- bundled built-in packs `doro`, `duodong`, and `chispa`,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- AI behavior decisions with Control Center replay and redacted diagnostics,
- permission-limited plugins,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC and Control Center view contracts.

## Read First

2. [`docs/development-summary.md`](./development-summary.md)
3. [`docs/project-context.json`](./project-context.json)
4. [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)
5. [`docs/release-checklist.md`](./release-checklist.md)

## Facts To Preserve

- `PetService` remains the single source of truth for pet state.
- New user-facing configuration belongs in Control Center.
- API keys must stay out of the renderer and ordinary plugins.
- Plugins keep permission review and isolation.
- `cat_anime/` structure is unchanged.
- Windows is not release-ready yet.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm start
npm run dev:control-center
npm test
npm run test:control-center
npm run typecheck
npm run check:syntax
npm run create-openpet-plugin -- "My Plugin" --template minimal --output-dir scratch/plugins
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-runbook
npm run run-packaged-runtime-smoke
npm run validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-release-evidence-archive-manifest
```

## Where To Look For Detail

- `docs/phases/` for phase records.
- `docs/reviews/` for phase review notes.
- `docs/project-status-review.md` for longer evaluation.
- `docs/productization-next-steps-design.md` for the latest review-derived TODO design.
- `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` for the Phase 38+ execution design.
- `docs/project-review-todo-design.md` for the consolidated whole-project review TODO design.
- `docs/productization-todo-design.md` for the prioritized TODO implementation design.
- `docs/desktop-release-design.md` for desktop release evidence.
- `docs/plugin-sandbox-evaluation.md` for current plugin runner guarantees, limits, and v1.1 recommendation.
- `scripts/run-packaged-runtime-smoke.js`, `scripts/create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js`, and `scripts/validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js` for packaged app runtime evidence.
- `scripts/create-release-evidence-archive-manifest.js` for release-level evidence archive validation.
- `docs/plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md` for plugin onboarding.
- `scripts/create-openpet-plugin.js` for plugin starter templates.

## Next Steps

1. Use `docs/project-review-todo-design.md` as the current whole-project TODO design, `docs/productization-next-steps-design.md` as the near-term productization design, and `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` as the phase execution entry.
2. Use Phase 41 AI behavior replay/decision viewer as the current diagnostics baseline.
3. Use the archived Phase 42 packaged runtime evidence as the automated macOS runtime baseline; fill native picker and signed archive evidence before claiming full runtime or release readiness.
