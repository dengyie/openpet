# OpenPet Handoff

> Last updated: 2026-06-17 | Branch: `codex/plugin-setup-status`

## Current Snapshot

OpenPet is a desktop pet platform with:

- Electron pet window runtime,
- React + Vite Control Center,
- pet pack runtime with Codex pet import and zip import,
- bundled built-in packs `doro`, `duodong`, and `chispa`,
- AI chat with secret storage in the main process,
- AI behavior decisions with Control Center replay and redacted diagnostics,
- developer-first local extension docs with visible `entries.setup` status, `entries.commands` compatibility runtime support, explicit dashboard opening, explicit service start/stop controls, explicit loopback service health checks, and best-effort service process-group cleanup,
- loopback-only local HTTP / MCP,
- and a TypeScript migration baseline covering shared IPC, Control Center view contracts, the Control Center API facade, Control Center hook state boundaries, Control Center pane prop surfaces, main-process Control Center adapters for service/catalog/plugin/pet pack/About/update/actions payloads, plugin extension entry contracts, full release evidence archive / signed closure report contracts, and representative payload fixtures.

## Read First

1. [`docs/development-summary.md`](./development-summary.md)
2. [`docs/project-context.json`](./project-context.json)
3. [`docs/project-status-review.md`](./project-status-review.md)
4. [`docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md`](./productization-v1.1-todo-design.md)
5. [`docs/project-documentation-design.md`](./project-documentation-design.md)

## Facts To Preserve

- `PetService` remains the single source of truth for pet state.
- New user-facing configuration belongs in Control Center.
- API keys must stay out of the renderer.
- Extension docs must be honest: OpenPet now parses declarations, shows `entries.setup` with read-only `not-run` status, can run `entries.commands` through the JavaScript compatibility runner when `main` exists, can explicitly open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards for enabled plugins, can explicitly start/stop declared local service entries, can manually check declared loopback service health endpoints, and attempts best-effort process-group cleanup when stopping service entries. Services do not auto-start, service commands are spawned without shell expansion, health checks do not run in the background, setup commands are not executed, bridge token injection, generic shell command execution, and hard process-tree cleanup guarantees are not implemented yet, and OpenPet does not claim complete sandboxing for arbitrary local processes.
- `cat_anime/` structure is unchanged.
- Windows is not release-ready yet.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm start
npm run dev:control-center
npm test                     # 446/446 Node tests
npm run test:control-center
npm run typecheck
npm run check:syntax
npm run create-openpet-plugin -- "My Plugin" --template minimal --output-dir scratch/plugins
npm run create-plugin-author-rehearsal
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-packaged-runtime-smoke-runbook
npm run run-packaged-runtime-smoke
npm run validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report
npm run create-release-evidence-archive-manifest
npm run create-signed-release-closure-report
```

## Where To Look For Detail

- `docs/phases/` for phase records.
- `docs/reviews/` for phase review notes.
- `docs/project-status-review.md` for longer evaluation.
- `docs/productization-v1.1-todo-design.md` for the Phase 38+ execution design.
- `docs/project-review-todo-design.md` for the consolidated whole-project review TODO design.
- `docs/productization-todo-design.md` for the prioritized TODO implementation design.
- `docs/desktop-release-design.md` for desktop release evidence.
- `docs/plugin-sandbox-evaluation.md` for current plugin runner guarantees, limits, and v1.1 recommendation.
- `scripts/run-packaged-runtime-smoke.js`, `scripts/create-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js`, and `scripts/validate-packaged-runtime-smoke-report.js` for packaged app runtime evidence.
- `scripts/create-release-evidence-archive-manifest.js` and `scripts/create-signed-release-closure-report.js` for release-level evidence archive validation and release-claim closure.
- `docs/plugin-development.md`, `docs/plugin-ecosystem-rules.md`, and `docs/plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md` for extension onboarding and legacy SDK compatibility.
- `scripts/create-openpet-plugin.js` and `scripts/create-plugin-author-rehearsal.js` for current compatibility starter templates and author-path rehearsal.

## Next Steps

1. Use the archived Phase 43 signed release closure report as the current release-claim gate: official desktop, macOS, and Windows release readiness remain `not-ready` until signed evidence and platform smoke reports are complete.
2. Use Phase 60 plugin setup/status and service cleanup as the current runtime boundary: setup entries are visible with read-only `not-run` status, `entries.commands` can run only through the existing JavaScript compatibility path, dashboard entries can be opened explicitly as external HTTP/HTTPS URLs, service entries can be explicitly started/stopped with runtime state and logs, health checks are explicit loopback-only actions, and service stops attempt best-effort process-group cleanup.
3. Use Phase 54 Release Evidence Contracts plus Phase 59 plugin entry/dashboard/service health contracts as the current TypeScript migration baseline.
4. After Phase 60, start the next concrete phase from service setup, bridge integration, real evidence work, community extension rehearsal, hard process-tree guarantees, or another high-drift service/report boundary.
