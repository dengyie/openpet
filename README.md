OpenPet puts a small animated pet on your desktop and gives it a real platform behind the scenes. The pet can walk, speak, play actions, switch character packs, react to AI replies, and grow through a developer-first local extension ecosystem.

If you are looking for a desktop pet project that is more than a renderer demo, OpenPet is built to be inspected, extended, and shipped: the app has a real service layer, a visual settings surface, plugin lifecycle controls, AI provider boundaries, pet-pack tooling, and repeatable evidence scripts.

The project is currently a release-candidate desktop platform rather than a toy demo: it has a real Electron service layer, a React Control Center, bundled pet packs, OpenAI-compatible AI settings, local extension runtime controls, loopback-only automation APIs, and release evidence tooling.

The current release track is macOS-first. Windows build and validation tooling exists, but Windows is not advertised as release-ready until signed installer evidence and real smoke reports are archived.

## Why Star OpenPet

- It turns a desktop pet into a programmable local platform with explicit service boundaries.
- It keeps sensitive AI and image-provider credentials in the Electron main process.
- It supports real user content through pet packs, Creator Studio, and reviewable import flows.
- It treats extension execution honestly: local plugins are explicit, logged, permission-gated, and never described as a complete arbitrary-process sandbox.
- It comes with a growing regression and release-evidence suite, so contributors can change behavior without relying on screenshots and guesses.

## Who It Is For

- Users who want a desktop companion with AI-assisted dialogue and switchable pet packs.
- Plugin authors who want a local-first extension host with clear permission and lifecycle rules.
- Electron developers who want a concrete reference for main-process service layering, renderer-safe IPC contracts, and desktop release evidence.

## What You Get

- Transparent desktop pet window with drag, walking, actions, and speech bubbles.
- React + Vite Control Center for Pet, Actions, AI, Plugins, Catalog, Service, and About settings, including compact narrow-window layouts.
- Pet pack runtime with legacy cat support, folder import, `.codex-pet.zip` import, and native `pet.json` + `spritesheet.webp` Codex pet atlases.
- Three bundled built-in pets: `doro`, `duodong`, and `chispa`.
- OpenAI-compatible chat and image-provider configuration with API keys kept in the main process secret store.
- Creator Studio workflows for prompt planning, image-backed atlas generation, frame repair, approval, dashboard review, and pet/action import.
- Developer-first local extension model with current legacy SDK compatibility, explicit command/dashboard/service controls, creator-tools action, pack-manifest, package-local asset, user-approved picker asset bridges, cleanup evidence tooling, validation, logs, catalog install, and uninstall flow.
- Optional loopback-only HTTP and MCP endpoints for local tools and agents.
- Gradual TypeScript migration baseline covering shared contracts and the Control Center API facade.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 9 or newer
- macOS for the currently validated packaged app path

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dengyie/OpenPet.git
cd OpenPet
npm install
npm start
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm start                    # Build Control Center and launch Electron
npm run dev:control-center   # Control Center hot reload at http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run test:core            # Core Node runtime regression suite
npm run test:core:all        # Core Node suite + Control Center Playwright suite
npm run test:tools           # Release/tooling Node tests
npm test                     # Full Node test suite
npm run test:control-center  # Playwright UI regression suite
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript no-emit check
npm run check:syntax         # Node syntax + typecheck + Control Center build
npm run pack                 # electron-builder directory package
npm run dist                 # macOS DMG/ZIP on macOS
```

## Project Shape

OpenPet is split into a small pet renderer, an Electron main process, and an embedded Control Center.

```text
main.js
  assembles services and Electron lifecycle

src/main/services/
  EventBus -> SettingsService -> ActionService -> PetService
                                      |-> AiService
                                      |-> PluginService
                                      |-> LocalHttpService / MCP

src/main/services/plugin-*.js
  plugin discovery, JSON/storage/log/network helpers, and local runner boundary modules

src/control-center/
  React + Vite UI embedded in Electron

src/main/pet-pack/
  pet.json schema, loader, importer, Codex atlas adapter
```

Important project rules:

- `PetService` is the single source of truth for pet state.
- User-facing configuration belongs in Control Center, not manual JSON edits.
- API keys never go to the renderer.
- Third-party extensions are local software: OpenPet should show what they declare and manage lifecycle/logs/uninstall, without claiming a complete sandbox for arbitrary local processes.
- The existing `cat_anime/` material structure is kept intact.

## Pet Packs

OpenPet supports:

- Built-in legacy cat assets from `cat_anime/`.
- User-imported action frame folders.
- OpenPet pet packs with `pet.json`.
- Codex-compatible pet directories containing `pet.json` and `spritesheet.webp`.
- Codex pet zip packages.
- Built-in read-only packs under `assets/pet-packs/`.

To add a new action manually, put ordered transparent frames under `cat_anime/flames/<action>/` and run:

```bash
npm run generate-sprites
```

For normal use, import pet packs from Control Center -> Actions -> Pet Packs.

## Extension Development

OpenPet uses one third-party package model: an extension. The package manifest is still named `plugin.json` for compatibility. The host now normalizes and inspects extension declarations for `entries.setup`, `entries.commands`, `entries.services`, `entries.dashboards`, `manifest`, `config`, and `assets`; JavaScript compatibility packages can expose `entries.commands` through the existing runner, and declaration-only local extensions can run short-lived `entries.commands` as explicit user actions with JSON stdin context and a short-lived bridge for `pet.say`, `pet.action`, `pet.event`, bounded context reads, creator-tools action reads/writes, active installed pack manifest metadata workflows, package-local frame inspection/import, and user-approved picker frame inspection/import. Enabled plugins can explicitly run declared setup entries, open declared HTTP/HTTPS dashboards, start or stop declared service entries, manually check declared loopback service health endpoints, and enable host-managed periodic checks for already-running services from Control Center. Command, setup, and service processes are spawned without shell expansion, services do not auto-start, and setup and commands do not run during install or enable. Arbitrary shell consoles, arbitrary file writes, raw filesystem grants, general pet-pack writes, and hard process-tree guarantees remain future runtime work.

Current legacy SDK examples are still useful while the host runtime catches up:

- [Focus Timer](./examples/plugins/focus-timer/) for storage and pet speech.
- [Weather Status](./examples/plugins/weather-status/) for legacy network allowlists.
- [RSS Reader](./examples/plugins/rss-reader/) for public feed fetching and cached announcements.

Target extension shape:

```text
my-extension/
  plugin.json
  config.schema.json   # optional
  commands/
  service/
  web/
  assets/
```

Current validation and submission tooling still uses the historical "plugin" command name:

```bash
npm run validate:plugin -- <plugin-dir-or-zip>
npm run create-plugin-submission-bundle -- <plugin-dir-or-zip> --output-dir plugin-submission-bundle
npm run validate-plugin-submission-bundle -- plugin-submission-bundle --require-ready
```

Read [plugin-development.md](./docs/plugin-development.md) and [plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md](./docs/plugin-submission-workflow-playbook.md) for the full path.
Extension authors should also read [plugin-ecosystem-rules.md](./docs/plugin-ecosystem-rules.md) for lifecycle, transparency, compatibility, and honest safety boundaries.
